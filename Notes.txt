RabbitMQ :

Message broker that implements AMQP- Advance Message Quing Protocol.
AMQP standardizes messaging using producers, Broker and Consumers.


Message Broker(Postal Service)
Asynchronious Communication

		/-------------> Queue ----> Consumer
Producer ----> EXCHANGE  -----> Queue ----> Consumer
		\-------------> Queue ----> Consumer
Exchange:
brain behind rabbitmq
Ex- like a inner working of post office


# Message distribution depends on exchange type.
# There are four type of xchage :
		- Direct
		- Fanout
		- Topic
		- Headers


#Direct Exchange : 
 - In this type of exchange, Message is directly routed to the queue 
    whose binding key matches with the routing key of the message. 

#Fanout Exchange :
  - In this type of exchange, Message is routed to the 
    all the queues which are bound to it.

#Topic Exchange : 
   - In this type of exchange, Message is routed to the queue on the basis of
     wildcard matches between routing key and binding key.

#Header Exchange : 
   - In this type of exchange, Header attribute is used for routing
	


#Queue:
 - It is buffer that stores a message that are sent from the exchange to queues.
 * Properties of queue :
	1) Durability : 
		i) Durable: If we mark queue as Durable, then it will survive even after server restarts.
	        ii) Transient: If we mark exchange as Transient, then it will not survive after server restarts.
	2) Arguments : 
		

#Bindings : A relationship between Exchange and Queue.
	   - It is used to configure relation betn xchnage and queue.	

#Connection: TCP connection betn our application and rabbitMQ broker.
#Channel : Virtual connection inside a connection
	   - Publishing or consuming a message from queue will happen over a channel.


When producer creates a message it will not directly go to queue
instead it will go to the exchanges, then routing agent will read and send it to the appropriate queue.
